    //  Problem #3:Sum numbers from 1 to N

    int n;
    cin >> n;

    cout << n * (n + 1) / 2;

    /*
 Why this equation?
 Here is an intuition for N = 8
 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 + 8
 Let's arrange as following
 1 8   2 7    3 6     4 5       [first number and last number]   [2nd number, and 2nd from back] ...
 What is the value of each pair? 9 = n+1
 How many pairs? 4 = n/2

 So n/2 pair, each has value n+1
 So total sum is (n * (n+1))/2

 Now, this works for even N
 Your turn: why works for odd N
